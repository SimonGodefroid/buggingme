      <h2>3. WHAT LEGAL BASES DO WE RELY ON TO PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION?</h2>
      <br />
      In Short: We only process your personal information when we believe it is
      necessary and we have a valid legal reason (i.e., legal basis) to do so
      under applicable law, like with your consent, to comply with laws, to

      obligations, to protect your rights, or to fulfill our legitimate business
      interests.
      <br />
      If you are located in the EU or UK, this section applies to you.
      <br />
      The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR require us to
      explain the valid legal bases we rely on in order to process your personal
      information. As such, we may rely on the following legal bases to process
      your personal information:
      <br />
      Consent. We may process your information if you have given us permission
      (i.e., consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose.
      You can withdraw your consent at any time. Learn more about withdrawing
      your consent.
      <br />
      Legal Obligations. We may process your information where we believe it is
      necessary for compliance with our legal obligations, such as to cooperate
      with a law enforcement body or regulatory agency, exercise or defend our
      legal rights, or disclose your information as evidence in litigation in
      which we are involved.
      <br />
      Vital Interests. We may process your information where we believe it is
      necessary to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of a
      third party, such as situations involving potential threats to the safety
      of any person.
      <br />
      If you are located in Canada, this section applies to you.
      <br />
      We may process your information if you have given us specific permission
      (i.e., express consent) to use your personal information for a specific
      purpose, or in situations where your permission can be inferred (i.e.,
      implied consent). You can withdraw your consent at any time.
      <br />
      In some exceptional cases, we may be legally permitted under applicable
      law to process your information without your consent, including, for
      example:
      <br />
      If collection is clearly in the interests of an individual and consent
      cannot be obtained in a timely way
      <br />
      For investigations and fraud detection and prevention
      <br />
      For business transactions provided certain conditions are met
      <br />
      If it is contained in a witness statement and the collection is necessary
      to assess, process, or settle an insurance claim
      <br />
      For identifying injured, ill, or deceased persons and communicating with
      next of kin
      <br />
      If we have reasonable grounds to believe an individual has been, is, or
      may be victim of financial abuse
      <br />
      If it is reasonable to expect collection and use with consent would
      compromise the availability or the accuracy of the information and the
      collection is reasonable for purposes related to investigating a breach of
      an agreement or a contravention of the laws of Canada or a province
      <br />
      If disclosure is required to comply with a subpoena, warrant, court order,
      or rules of the court relating to the production of records
      <br />
      If it was produced by an individual in the course of their employment,
      business, or profession and the collection is consistent with the purposes
      for which the information was produced
      <br />
      If the collection is solely for journalistic, artistic, or literary
      purposes
      <br />
      If the information is publicly available and is specified by the
      regulations
      <br />
      <h2>4. WHEN AND WITH WHOM DO WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?</h2>

      help manage and display advertisements, to tailor advertisements to your
      interests, or to send abandoned shopping cart reminders (depending on your
      communication preferences). The third parties and service providers use
      their technology to provide advertising about products and services
      tailored to your interests which may appear either on our Services or on
      other websites.
      <br />

      the applicable laws) under applicable US state laws, you can opt out of
      these online tracking technologies by submitting a request as described
      below under section "DO UNITED STATES RESIDENTS HAVE SPECIFIC PRIVACY
      RIGHTS?"

      on the relevant Services. Please note that we do not control, and are not
      responsible for, other uses of your personal information by your
      third-party social media provider. We recommend that you review their
      privacy notice to understand how they collect, use, and share your
      personal information, and how you can set your privacy preferences on
      their sites and apps.
      <br />
      <h2>7. IS YOUR INFORMATION TRANSFERRED INTERNATIONALLY?</h2>
      <br />
      In Short: We may transfer, store, and process your information in

      <br />
      If you are a resident in the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom
      (UK), or Switzerland, then these countries may not necessarily have data
      protection laws or other similar laws as comprehensive as those in your
      country. However, we will take all necessary measures to protect your
      personal information in accordance with this privacy notice and applicable
      law.

      for the purposes set out in this privacy notice, unless a longer retention
      period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other
      legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will require us keeping
      your personal information for longer than .<br />
      When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal
      information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if
      this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has
      been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal
      information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is
      possible.
      <br />
      <h2>9.DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM MINORS?</h2>

      are the parent or guardian of such a minor and consent to such minor
      dependent’s use of the Services. If we learn that personal information

      such data from our records. If you become aware of any data we may have
      collected from children under age 18, please contact us at __________.
      <br />
      <h2>10. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?</h2>
      <br />
      In Short: Depending on your state of residence in the US or in some
      regions, such as the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom (UK),
      Switzerland, and Canada, you have rights that allow you greater access to
      and control over your personal information. You may review, change, or
      terminate your account at any time, depending on your country, province,
      or state of residence.
      <br />
      In some regions (like the EEA, UK, Switzerland, and Canada), you have
      certain rights under applicable data protection laws. These may include
      the right (i) to request access and obtain a copy of your personal
      information, (ii) to request rectification or erasure; (iii) to restrict
      the processing of your personal information; (iv) if applicable, to data
      portability; and (v) not to be subject to automated decision-making. In
      certain circumstances, you may also have the right to object to the
      processing of your personal information. You can make such a request by
      contacting us by using the contact details provided in the section "HOW
      CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?" below.
      <br />
      We will consider and act upon any request in accordance with applicable
      data protection laws.
      <br /> <br />
      If you are located in the EEA or UK and you believe we are unlawfully
      processing your personal information, you also have the right to complain
      to your Member State data protection authority or UK data protection
      authority.
      <br />
      If you are located in Switzerland, you may contact the Federal Data
      Protection and Information Commissioner.
      <br />
      Withdrawing your consent: If we are relying on your consent to process
      your personal information, which may be express and/or implied consent
      depending on the applicable law, you have the right to withdraw your
      consent at any time. You can withdraw your consent at any time by
      contacting us by using the contact details provided in the section "HOW
      CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?" below.
      <br />
      However, please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of the
      processing before its withdrawal nor, when applicable law allows, will it
      affect the processing of your personal information conducted in reliance
      on lawful processing grounds other than consent.
      <br />
      Account Information
      <br />
      If you would at any time like to review or change the information in your
      account or terminate your account, you can:
      <br />
      Log in to your account settings and update your user account.
      <br />
      Upon your request to terminate your account, we will deactivate or delete
      your account and information from our active databases. However, we may
      retain some information in our files to prevent fraud, troubleshoot
      problems, assist with any investigations, enforce our legal terms and/or
      comply with applicable legal requirements.
      <br />
      <h2>11. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h2>
      <br />
      Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile
      applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can
      activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your
      online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage, no
      uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals
      has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser
      signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice
      not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted
      that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice
      in a revised version of this privacy notice.
      <br />
      California law requires us to let you know how we respond to web browser
      DNT signals. Because there currently is not an industry or legal standard
      for recognizing or honoring DNT signals, we do not respond to them at this
      time.
      <br />

      <br />
      Under certain US state data protection laws, you can designate an
      authorized agent to make a request on your behalf. We may deny a request

      to verify your identity or authority to make the request. However, if we
      cannot verify your identity from the information already maintained by us,
      we may request that you provide additional information for the purposes of
      verifying your identity and for security or fraud-prevention purposes.
      <br />
      If you submit the request through an authorized agent, we may need to
      collect additional information to verify your identity before processing
      your request and the agent will need to provide a written and signed
      permission from you to submit such request on your behalf.
